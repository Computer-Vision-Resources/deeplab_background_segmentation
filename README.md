# Mobile Machine Learning Models

This repository contains several machine learning models running on mobile devices. 

## Models

-   [deeplab](deeplab):  state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation

## Notes
There is an issue causing the runtime crash during the model initialization.
It seems to be fixed with [this comment](https://github.com/dailystudio/ml/issues/3#issuecomment-447702487).
